# Close Window in Alt-Tab Switcher (Cinnamon Extension)

This Cinnamon extension restores a workflow that used to work in older versions of Linux Mint:
when cycling windows with **Alt+Tab** (or **Super+Tab**), you can press **Q** to close the
currently highlighted window directly from the switcher.

## Features

- Press **Q** while the Alt-Tab switcher is open to close the selected window.
- Works with both lowercase `q` and uppercase `Q`.
- Lightweight and minimal patch on Cinnamon's app switcher.

## Installation

### From source (manual install)

3. Enable it in System Settings â†’ Extensions.
